### NOTE/DISCLAIMER:  

This project/game is experimental, and currently uses the OpenAI API to generate/parse content, such as creating hypothetical polls

This project is on-hold until there are generative AI models with lower latency, greater accuracy/reasoning and reasonable API costs available,
due to this project requiring a combination of all 3 factors (I.e GPT-4 is too expensive and slow, and GPT 3.5 is too inaccurate)
